# TumblrSnap
A fun photos app built on Tumblr. Used for our CodePath bootcamp.

**Note**: The main branch has certain key code removed specifically focused around interacting with the gallery and the camera. 
This is an intentional part of the assignment to fill this code back in to make the app work.
